## About

This is a puzzle game along the lines of Tetris, Columns, Dr. Mario, etc.
Use a cursor to swap blocks horizontally or vertically. Match 3 blocks of the same color to remove them from the board, and shoot a beam of light in the direction of the match!
Large junk pieces periodically fall from the top of the board. Hit them with a beam of light to shatter them into more blocks that you can match up!
Some junk has a color, and you must hit it with a beam of the same color to shatter them.
The game is over when there is no room for the next junk piece to be placed!
